# Learning-Chinese
This repository include the slides, hw, related book about teaching Chinese.  

The slides are created by myself, I teached first-level students (less than 10 years old kids) Chinese for 1 year. 
Here includes everything that I used during this year. 

The slides are easy to read with cute cartoon images, some of them have the voice of my pronuncation.
